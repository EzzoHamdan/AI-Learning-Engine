```env
# Local AI (automatically detected)
LOCAL_AI_MODEL="gemma2:2b"

# Google AI
GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY=your_google_ai_key_here

# OpenAI (optional)  
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here

# Debug mode
DEBUG=false

# Set to true only when hosting the app (e.g. Streamlit Cloud).
# Controls cloud-deployment behavior; leave unset/false for local use.
DEPLOYED=false
```

### Runtime Configuration
- 🔑 **API Keys**: Enter directly in the app sidebar (used for the current session)
- 🌱 **Persistent keys**: Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` / `GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY` in your environment (`.env`) or, when deployed, in Streamlit secrets
- 🔄 **Provider Switching**: Change AI providers instantly
- ⚙️ **Model Selection**: Choose specific models for each provider 

## 📊 Performance & Scalability

### Document Processing
- **File Size**: Up to 50MB supported
- **Formats**: PDF, DOCX, PPTX with advanced text extraction

### Generation Speed
- **Quiz Generation**: 10-30 seconds (varies by complexity and amount of questions)
- **Study Materials**: 10-30 seconds (varies by material type and demanded task)
- **Local AI**: Hardware dependent
- **Cloud AI**: Network dependent

### Resource Usage Regarding Local AI
- **RAM**: 2-16GB (depends on Local AI model size)
- **Storage**: 500MB app + 1-30GB models (Local AI only)
- **CPU**: Modern processor recommended for Local AI

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

### Data Handling
- **Local AI**: ✅ **Zero data sharing** - everything stays on your device
- **Cloud AI**: ⚠️ Data sent to provider APIs (encrypted in transit)
- **No Analytics**: No usage tracking or data collection
- **Key Storage**: API keys are session-scoped in the app, or read from environment variables / Streamlit secrets — the app never writes keys to disk

### Best Practices
- 🏠 Use **Local AI** for privacy and unlimited studying
- 🔐 Never share API keys publicly
- 🔄 Rotate API keys regularly if using cloud providers
- 💾 Save your generated study materials for exam review

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **"No AI provider available"**: Configure API keys in sidebar or create a .env
- **Slow generation**: Try smaller Local AI models or check network
- **Upload errors**: Ensure file is under 50MB and valid format
- **Memory issues**: Use smaller models or close other applications

### Getting Help
1. 🔍 Check **Provider Status** in the app sidebar
2. 📊 Enable **Debug Mode** in configuration
3. 📝 Check terminal/console for error messages
4. 🔄 Try switching to different AI provider
5. 🌐 Verify internet connection for cloud providers
